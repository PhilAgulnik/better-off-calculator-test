            <h2>What is the Minimum Income Floor?</h2>
            <p>
              The Minimum Income Floor (MIF) is a rule that applies to self-employed Universal Credit claimants. 
              It assumes you earn at least the equivalent of working 35 hours per week at the National Living Wage, 
              even if your actual earnings are lower.
            </p>
            
            <div className="key-points">
              <h3>Key Points:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Start-up Period:</strong> The MIF applies after a 12-month "start-up period" for new businesses</li>
                <li><strong>Calculation Basis:</strong> It's calculated based on your age, family circumstances, and any disabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> If your actual earnings are below the MIF, Universal Credit will be calculated using the MIF amount instead</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This can significantly affect your Universal Credit entitlement</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div className="important-note">
              <p><strong>Important:</strong> The MIF is designed to encourage self-employed people to work sufficient hours 
              and earn enough to support themselves, similar to employed claimants.</p>
