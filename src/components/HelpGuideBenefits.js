            <h2>Housing Benefit and Local Housing Allowance</h2>
            <p>If you're renting privately, your housing costs are covered through the housing element of Universal Credit. This is based on Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rates in your area.</p>

              <h3>Important Information:</h3>

            <h2>Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</h2>
            <p>ESA is for people who can't work due to illness or disability. It's being replaced by Universal Credit, but some people may still be able to claim it.</p>

                <li>It's paid in addition to other benefits</li>
